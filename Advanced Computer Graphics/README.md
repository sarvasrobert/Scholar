## Exercises from Advanced Computer Graphics seminar   

Here are some examples of my CPU based raytracer created in C# during the lessons of ACG. /n \n
Exercise 5 focus on creating of various light sources
Excercise 6 focus on creating of physicaly based reflections and refractions
Excercise 8 focus on Postprocessing such as Antialiasing and  Depth of field
