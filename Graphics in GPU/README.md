# Graphics on GPU 

## Mini project created at seminar Grahics on GPU.  


Project is created in C++, OpenGL with Glut & Glew libraries.
Its a simple scene of 5 textured objects loaded from Collada files, 
illuminated with basic Phong illumination model.

Models and light are animated. Camera can be rotated by WSAD keyboards and move forward by K and backward by L keyboard.  
In project I created fog with Depth Buffer to simulate density of water.
With H you can turn of "FOG" and with G you can switch between exponential or linear fog.
